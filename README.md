# HPC2edge

Edge/HPC-hybrid AI model optimization framework. Leverage High-Performance Computing for EdgeAI tuning by employing remote and asynchronous AI inference on the edge.

## Project structure

The project is currently divided in two parts: 
- Database ([`db/`](db/)): asynchronous communication between Edge & HPC using a PostgreSQL database;
- Neural Networks ([`nn/`](nn/)): training and inference of NNs using Pytorch.
